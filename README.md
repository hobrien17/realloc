# realloc

A python-based staff allocation tool designed to find the optimal assignment of staff members to shifts based on their availability and preferences.

## Updated Backend

An extension has been made to the realloc backend (https://github.com/hobrien17/realloc-adv), using theorem proving to generate allocations instead of optimisation algorithms. It is planned to eventually integrate this with the frontend in this repository.
